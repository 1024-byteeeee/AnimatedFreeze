# AnimatedFreeze

[**中文**](README.md) **|** [**English**]

## Introduction

- This mod allows you to disable animation effects for any material using commands.
- It includes the functionality of the [FastChest](https://github.com/FakeDomi/FastChest) mod. You only need to enable the built-in resource pack and place it first.
- Feel free to submit an issue for any missing parts.
- Some resource packs may be incompatible, and issues related to this will not be addressed.

## Commands

- **/animatedFreeze add <Material Name>**

  Add a material that needs animation disabled.

  > The suggested values for the command are not mandatory, you are free to enter the correct material name even if it does not exist among the suggested values for the command.

- **/animatedFreeze remove <Material Name>**

  Remove a material that has had its animation disabled.

- **/animatedFreeze removeAll**

  Unfreeze all materials.

- **/animatedFreeze list**

  View the list of materials with animation disabled.



## Resource Packs

- **af_mod/chest_optimization**

  Changes the rendering method for chests, significantly boosting FPS (when using this, place this resource pack first in the list).

  This implementation is essentially the same as the [FastChest](https://github.com/FakeDomi/FastChest) mod, so any issues related to this resource pack can refer to the [FastChest README](https://github.com/FakeDomi/FastChest/blob/master/README.md).

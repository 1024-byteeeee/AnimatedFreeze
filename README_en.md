# AnimatedFreeze

[**中文**](README.md) **|** [**English**]

## Into

- This module adds some built-in resource packs designed to disable certain texture animations or change their rendering approach to improve game performance.



- It may be incompatible with some resource packs, and issues related to these incompatibilities will not be addressed.



## Resource Packs

- **af_mod/chest_optimization**

  Changes the rendering method for chests, significantly boosting FPS (when using this, place this resource pack first in the list).

  This implementation is essentially the same as the [FastChest](https://github.com/FakeDomi/FastChest) mod, so any issues related to this resource pack can refer to the [FastChest README](https://github.com/FakeDomi/FastChest/blob/master/README.md).



- **af_mod/kelp_freeze**

  Removes the swaying animation of kelp.



- **af_mod/sea_lantern_freeze**

  Removes the animation from sea lanterns.



- **af_mod/seagrass_freeze**

  Removes the swaying animation of seagrass.
